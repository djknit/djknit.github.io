          <p class="about">
            <span class="placeholder">&nbsp;</span> I am a Full-Stack Developer
            with a passion for creating user-friendly, functional tools that
            address real-world problems. I am proficient at using HTML, CSS, and
            Javascript to create complete dynamic web-pages with complex
            functionality and precise positioning. I am detail- oriented and
            well organized. These qualities helped me to succeed in earning both
            a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics and a Bachelor of Arts in
            chemistry in my four years at the University of Kansas. It is my
            lifelong passion for mathematics that drew me towards computer
            programming. I believe that writing code and practicing mathematics
            require very similar skill sets. My experience writing mathematical
            proofs gave me an understanding of the same logical structures that
            are used in programming. I am able to succeed in fast paced,
            team-driven environments. I can follow directions well, or take
            initiative where appropriate.<span class="end-placeholder">&nbsp;</span>

          <p class="about">
            I was born and raised in Manhattan KS. After graduating high school,
            I moved down the road to Lawrence to become a Jayhawk. In my four
            years at the University of Kansas in Lawrence, I completed a B.S. in
            math and a B.A. in chemistry. After graduation, I stayed in Lawrence
            to pursue my passion for making pizzas. I then left my career in
            pizza making to develop my skills for moving things around in a
            warehouse. Despite the naturally rewarding nature of my careers in
            pizza-making and general warehouse work, I have decided that it is
            now time to pursue a new career in web development.
            <span class="end-placeholder">&nbsp;</span>
          </p>
          <p class="about">
            My interests include all things related to math, science, and music.
            I enjoy coding because it involves the manipulation of precisely
            defined objects and rules. Because of this, I believe that the types
            of thought processes required to code successfully are similar to
            those required to be good at math. I am currently working to
            establish and sharpen my skills as a web developer. As I continue to
            build my knowledge of web-based development, I hope to also continue
            to expand my knowledge to include other areas of software
            development.<span class="end-placeholder">&nbsp;</span>
